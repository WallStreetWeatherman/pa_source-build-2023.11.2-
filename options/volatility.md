If your option has a short maturity (e.g., up to 6 months), consider using 6 months to a year of daily data.
For medium-term options (e.g., 1 to 2 years), 1 to 2 years of daily data might be appropriate.
For longer-term options, you might want to consider even longer data windows, like 2-5 years, to get a more comprehensive view of the stock's volatility characteristics.
