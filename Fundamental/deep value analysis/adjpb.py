# Adjusted Price to Book Value (P/B) Calculation
#
# Overview:
# The Price to Book Value (P/B) ratio compares a company's market price to its book value. 
# This script refines the standard P/B ratio by making certain adjustments to the book value. 
# Adjustments might include adding back specific write-offs or accounting for off-balance-sheet assets.
#
# Desired Value:
# Generally, a low adjusted P/B ratio might indicate that the stock is undervalued, 
# while a high P/B ratio could suggest overvaluation. However, industry comparisons 
# and further analysis are needed to draw concrete conclusions.
