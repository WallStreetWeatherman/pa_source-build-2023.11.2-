# Owner Earnings Analysis
# -----------------------
# Overview:
# Owner Earnings, as popularized by Warren Buffett, represent the true profitability of a company. 
# It is the cash flow that could be theoretically distributed to shareholders, after all operating expenses, 
# taxes, and reinvestment needs are covered. Itâ€™s considered a more realistic view of a company's real earning power.
# For a deep value investor, a growing trend in Owner Earnings over time suggests that the company's profitability 
# and intrinsic value are increasing.
# 
# Formula:
# Owner Earnings = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - CapEx - Changes in Working Capital
