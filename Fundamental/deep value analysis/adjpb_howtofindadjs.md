Finding the appropriate adjustments for the Price to Book Value (P/B) or any valuation metric requires a combination of financial statement analysis, industry knowledge, and a bit of detective work. Here are the steps and sources to find these adjustments:

Financial Statements:

Balance Sheet: Examine assets and liabilities for any anomalies or non-recurring items. Items that seem too high or too low can be adjusted for a more normalized view.
Income Statement: Look for non-operating or non-recurring items that might have affected the retained earnings (and thus equity). Large legal fines, for instance, might be deducted once but impact equity for years.
Cash Flow Statement: Identify items that impact cash flow but aren't part of normal operations, which can affect value.
Notes to Financial Statements:

Often, the adjustments or extraordinary items are explained in the notes. Always read them as they can provide invaluable insights.
Off-Balance Sheet Items:

Companies might have significant assets or liabilities that aren't on the balance sheet due to accounting rules. Operating leases were a classic example before accounting rule changes. Research and analysis can reveal these items.
Industry Reports:

Industry-specific reports can provide benchmarks and norms. If a company significantly deviates from these norms, it might be an indication of a required adjustment.
Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A):

The MD&A section in the annual report can provide clues. Management often discusses financial results and might explain anomalies.
Historical Comparisons:

If something is unusual in one year, comparing to past years can provide clarity. For example, a large asset write-off might be a one-time event.
Analyst Reports:

Equity research analysts often make adjustments in their models. Reviewing these reports can provide ideas for potential adjustments.
Company Press Releases and News:

Look for non-recurring events like lawsuits, asset sales, or restructuring.
Competitor Analysis:

Compare the company's balance sheet and P/B to its competitors. If there are significant differences, it might warrant a deeper look.
Industry Norms:

Some industries might have their quirks or specific items that need adjustments.
Tax Considerations:
Some assets or liabilities might exist for tax reasons and don't reflect economic reality. These might warrant an adjustment.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
These can significantly affect book value. Depending on the reliability and age of these assets, adjustments might be necessary.
Remember, while making these adjustments, the goal is to get a clearer picture of a company's intrinsic value. It's essential to ensure that adjustments aren't double-counted and are consistent with the overall analysis approach. Proper documentation and justification for each adjustment are vital.
