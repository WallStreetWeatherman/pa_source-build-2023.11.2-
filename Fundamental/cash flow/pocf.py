# Price-to-Operating Cash Flow Calculation
# ----------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Price-to-Operating Cash Flow ratio (P/OCF) measures the valuation of a company 
# relative to its operating cash flow. This ratio is particularly useful for companies 
# where cash flow is a more relevant metric than earnings, such as firms with significant 
# non-cash expenses or those in capital-intensive industries.
#
# Desired Value:
# A lower P/OCF ratio may suggest that a company is undervalued. However, it's important 
# to compare this ratio with peer companies in the same industry. A firm's growth prospects, 
# stability of cash flows, and industry dynamics should also be considered.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, input data 
# should be sourced from financial statements and market data.
