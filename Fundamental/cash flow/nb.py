# Net Burn Rate Calculator
# ------------------------
# Overview:
# The Net Burn Rate is a measure crucial for startups and unprofitable companies. 
# It indicates the rate at which a company is using (or "burning") its cash reserves.
#
# Formula:
# Net Burn Rate = (Starting Cash - Ending Cash) / Number of Months
#
# Desired Value:
# A lower net burn rate is generally more favorable, as it suggests that a company 
# has more time before it runs out of cash. It's crucial for startups and companies that 
# are not yet profitable to be aware of their net burn rate, so they can plan for future 
# funding needs or adjust their expenses.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Convert amounts where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc.
def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):
    return value_in_millions * 1000000

# Hard-coded values

# Starting Cash (at the beginning of the period) (in million dollars format for simplicity)
starting_cash_in_millions = 862.00  
starting_cash = convert_to_actual_value(starting_cash_in_millions)

# Ending Cash (at the end of the period) (in million dollars format for simplicity)
ending_cash_in_millions = 438.00  
ending_cash = convert_to_actual_value(ending_cash_in_millions)

# Number of Months for which the burn rate is being calculated
number_of_months = 12  # Example for a half-yearly assessment

# Calculate Net Burn Rate
net_burn_rate = (starting_cash - ending_cash) / number_of_months

# Convert the net burn rate back to the million-dollar format for readability
net_burn_rate_in_millions = net_burn_rate / 1000000

# Output the results
print(f"Net Burn Rate: ${net_burn_rate_in_millions:.2f} million per month")

if net_burn_rate_in_millions > 0:
    print(f"At this rate, the company will deplete its remaining cash in approximately {ending_cash / net_burn_rate:.2f} months.")
    print("Possible reasons for this burn rate include:")
    print("- High initial investments in infrastructure, technology, or talent.")
    print("- Marketing and customer acquisition costs exceeding revenues.")
    print("- Development of a product or service that hasn't reached market yet.")
    print("- Presence in a competitive market leading to higher operational costs.")
    print("- Potential unexpected expenses or costs overrun in some projects.")
    print("- Strategical decision to invest heavily to capture market share before becoming profitable.")
    print("It's essential for the company to reassess its spending, identify opportunities to optimize costs, and plan for future fundraising if needed.")

    print("Factors contributing to this positive scenario might include:")
    print("- Strong revenue growth outpacing expenses.")
    print("- Effective cost management and operational efficiencies.")
    print("- Having multiple revenue streams, ensuring consistent cash inflow.")
    print("- Successful fundraising rounds or external investments.")
    print("- Positive market reception, leading to faster-than-expected profitability.")
