# Price to Operating Cash Flow Ratio Calculation
# ----------------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Price to Operating Cash Flow ratio compares a company's market cap to its operating cash flow.
# It assesses a company's ability to produce cash from its core business operations relative to its market value.
#
# Desired Value:
# A lower Price to Operating Cash Flow ratio may suggest that the company is undervalued relative to its cash-generating ability. 
# However, this interpretation may vary based on industry standards and market conditions.

# Hardcoded values for the company
company_market_cap = 3029.00 # Market Cap in Tikr
company_operating_cash_flow = 1615.00 # Cash from Operations in Tikr

# Hardcoded values for the industry average
industry_avg_market_cap = 44750.00  
industry_avg_operating_cash_flow = 803.00

print("- **Revenue Recognition:** The timing of revenue recognition can impact the operating cash flow. Businesses that recognize revenue faster than they collect cash may have a temporary mismatch affecting the ratio.")
print("- **Working Capital Management:** Efficient management of inventories, accounts receivable, and accounts payable can lead to better cash flow from operations.")
print("- **Capital Expenditures:** While P/OCF focuses on operating cash flow, high capital expenditures might indicate that the company is reinvesting for growth, which could impact available free cash flow.")
print("- **Debt Management:** Companies with significant interest payments might see reduced operating cash flows if they aren't generating sufficient revenue.")
print("- **Economic Environment:** In downturns, companies with resilient operating cash flows might see their P/OCF ratios valued more favorably, as investors prioritize cash generation stability.")
print("- **Industry Lifecycle:** Industries in growth phases might have different cash flow patterns compared to mature industries, impacting the relative P/OCF ratios.")
print("- **Accounting Practices:** Differences in accounting methods can affect reported operating cash flow, impacting the ratio's comparability across companies.")
