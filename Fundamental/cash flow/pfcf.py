# Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio Calculator
# -----------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio measures the value of a company's stock relative to its operating cash flow per share.
# It provides an alternative to other stock valuation metrics such as the P/E ratio. This ratio can be useful in cases 
# where earnings can be affected by accounting treatments and non-cash items.
#
# Formula:
# Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio = Market Price per Share / Operating Cash Flow per Share
#
# Desired Value:
# A lower Price-to-Cash Flow indicates that the stock might be undervalued, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.
# A higher ratio might indicate overvaluation. However, the "appropriate" ratio can vary by industry and market conditions.
# It's crucial to compare this ratio with those of other companies in the same sector.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Convert amounts where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc.
def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):
    return value_in_millions * 1000000

# Hard-coded values

# Operating Cash Flow (in million dollars format)
operating_cash_flow_in_millions = 1583.00
operating_cash_flow = convert_to_actual_value(operating_cash_flow_in_millions)

# Number of Shares Outstanding (in million units format)
number_of_shares_in_millions = 273.63 
number_of_shares = convert_to_actual_value(number_of_shares_in_millions)

# Market Price per Share (in regular dollar format)
market_price_per_share = 11.11 

# Calculate Operating Cash Flow per Share
operating_cash_flow_per_share = operating_cash_flow / number_of_shares

# Calculate Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio
price_to_cash_flow_ratio = market_price_per_share / operating_cash_flow_per_share

# Output the results
