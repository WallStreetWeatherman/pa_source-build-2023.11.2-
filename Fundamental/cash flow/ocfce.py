# Operating Cash Flow to Capital Expenditure Ratio Calculator
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Operating Cash Flow to Capital Expenditure (OCF to CapEx) Ratio assesses how many times a company 
# can cover its capital expenditures from its operating cash flows. It provides insights into the company's 
# ability to sustain its capital spending without the need for external funding.
#
# Formula:
# OCF to CapEx Ratio = Cash Flow from Operations / Capital Expenditures
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher ratio indicates that the company has strong operating cash flows relative to its capital spending.
# A ratio less than 1 suggests that the company's operating cash flows are insufficient to cover its capital expenditures.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Convert amounts where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc.
def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):
    return value_in_millions * 1000000

# Hard-coded values for the company

cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions = 1615.00  # Cash from Operations
cash_flow_from_operations = convert_to_actual_value(cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions)

capital_expenditures_in_millions = 888.00  # Capital Expenditure in Tikr
capital_expenditures = convert_to_actual_value(capital_expenditures_in_millions)

# Calculate the company's OCF to CapEx Ratio
ocf_to_capex_ratio = cash_flow_from_operations / capital_expenditures

# Hard-coded values for industry average

industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions = 803.00  # Placeholder value
industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions)

industry_avg_capital_expenditures_in_millions = 182.00  # Placeholder value
industry_avg_capital_expenditures = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_capital_expenditures_in_millions)

# Calculate Industry Average OCF to CapEx Ratio
industry_avg_ocf_to_capex_ratio = industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations / industry_avg_capital_expenditures
