# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Analysis
# ------------------------------------
# Overview:
# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) reflects funds utilized by a company to acquire, maintain, or upgrade its physical assets.
#
# Desired Value:
# While higher CapEx can indicate significant investments in the future, consistently high CapEx without proportional returns
# may suggest inefficiencies or over-expansion. Ideally, CapEx should be balanced based on the company's growth and industry phase.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be fetched and updated accordingly.

def convert_to_actual_value(value):
    """Converts the value in the format of 1.00 to actual $1 million."""
    return value * 1000000

# Hard-coded value for Capital Expenditure
