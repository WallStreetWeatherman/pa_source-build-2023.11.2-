# Break-even Analysis Calculator
# ------------------------------
# Overview:
# Break-even analysis determines the point at which a company's revenues equal its total costs.
# It represents the sales amount required to cover both fixed and variable costs, resulting in no net profit or loss.
#
# Formula:
# Break-even Point (in units) = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
# Break-even Point (in sales) = Break-even Point (in units) * Selling Price per Unit
#
# Desired Value:
# A lower break-even point indicates that a company needs fewer sales to cover its costs. 
# A higher break-even point suggests a need for significant sales to achieve profitability.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications,
# the selling price, fixed costs, and variable costs values should be input.

# Hard-coded values in millions as decimals (e.g., 1.00 is $1 million)

# Selling Price per unit (in $1M units)
selling_price_per_unit = 0.05  # Example value representing $50,000 per unit

# Variable Cost per unit (in $1M units)
variable_cost_per_unit = 0.03  # Example value representing $30,000 per unit

# Total Fixed Costs for the period (in $1M)
fixed_costs = 10.00  # Example value representing $10 million

# Calculate Break-even Point in units
break_even_units = fixed_costs / (selling_price_per_unit - variable_cost_per_unit)

# Calculate Break-even Point in sales (in $1M)
break_even_sales = break_even_units * selling_price_per_unit

# Output the results
print(f"Break-even Point (in units): {break_even_units:.2f}")
print(f"Break-even Sales (in $1M): ${break_even_sales:.2f}M")
print("This indicates the sales required to cover both fixed and variable costs.")
