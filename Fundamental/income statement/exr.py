# Expense Ratio Calculator
# -------------------------
# Overview:
# The Expense Ratio is a measure primarily used in the mutual fund industry. It represents 
# the annual operating expenses as a percentage of the average assets under management (AUM). 
# It provides an indication of the efficiency of a fund's management â€“ the lower the expense ratio, 
# the less the fund's management is taking from its assets to run the fund.
#
# Formula:
# Expense Ratio = (Operating Expenses / Average AUM) x 100%
# 
# Desired Value:
# A lower Expense Ratio is generally more favorable for investors, as it implies lower operating 
# costs relative to the size of the fund. However, it should be compared with industry benchmarks and 
# the services provided by the fund.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications,
# actual operating expenses and average assets under management should be input.

# Hard-coded values in millions as decimals (e.g., 1.00 is $1 million)

# For the mutual fund
operating_expenses_fund = 2.50  # Example value representing $2.5 million
average_aum_fund = 100.00  # Example value representing $100 million

# Industry averages
operating_expenses_industry = 3.00  # Industry's average operating expenses in $ million
average_aum_industry = 125.00  # Industry's average assets under management in $ million

# Calculate Expense Ratio for the fund
expense_ratio_fund = (operating_expenses_fund / average_aum_fund) * 100

# Calculate Expense Ratio for the industry
expense_ratio_industry = (operating_expenses_industry / average_aum_industry) * 100

# Output the results
print("Expense Ratio Analysis:\n")
print(f"Fund's Expense Ratio: {expense_ratio_fund:.2f}%")
print(f"Industry Average Expense Ratio: {expense_ratio_industry:.2f}%\n")

# Analysis
if expense_ratio_fund < expense_ratio_industry:
    print("The fund's expense ratio is below the industry average. This can be favorable for investors.")
    print("\nPotential reasons for a lower expense ratio might include:")
    print("- Economies of scale achieved due to the size of the fund.")
    print("- Efficient management and operational practices.")
    print("- Lower marketing and distribution costs.")
    print("- Lesser reliance on external research and advisory services.")
elif expense_ratio_fund > expense_ratio_industry:
    print("The fund's expense ratio is above the industry average. Investors might want to further investigate the reasons.")
    print("\nFactors that can contribute to a higher expense ratio include:")
    print("- High fund management fees.")
    print("- Increased marketing and distribution costs.")
    print("- Use of costly external research or advisory services.")
    print("- Smaller size of the fund, which can result in lesser economies of scale.")
else:
    print("The fund's expense ratio is in line with the industry average.")
    print("\nIt's essential for investors to not only consider the expense ratio but also the services and performance provided by the fund.")
