# EBITDA Calculation
# ------------------
# Overview:
# EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) 
# is a measure of a company's operational profitability. It strips out 
# non-operational costs to focus purely on the business's ability to generate 
# earnings from its core operations.
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher EBITDA indicates operational profitability. However, context is crucial, 
# as some sectors naturally have higher EBITDAs. An extremely high EBITDA doesn't 
# always mean the company is financially sound.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be adjusted accordingly.

def convert_to_actual_value(value):
    """Converts the value in the format of 1.00 to actual $1 million."""
    return value * 1000000

# Hard-coded values for revenues, costs, depreciation, and amortization
revenues = convert_to_actual_value(50.00)        # Example: $50 million in revenues
operating_costs = convert_to_actual_value(25.00) # Example: $25 million in operating costs
depreciation = convert_to_actual_value(5.00)     # Example: $5 million in depreciation
amortization = convert_to_actual_value(3.00)     # Example: $3 million in amortization

# Calculate EBITDA
ebitda = revenues - operating_costs - depreciation - amortization

# Output the result
desired_ebitda_value = convert_to_actual_value(20.00) # An example desired value for EBITDA

print("EBITDA Calculation:\n")
print(f"Calculated EBITDA based on given assumptions: ${ebitda/1000000:,.2f} million")
