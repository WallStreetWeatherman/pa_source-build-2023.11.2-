# Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Calculation
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Overview:
# This represents the average number of diluted shares over a specified period, 
# taking into account any changes in share count and potential dilutive securities.
#
# Desired Value:
# The impact of a rising or declining number of Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding 
# depends on the context. Generally, a rising share count can dilute shareholder value 
# unless earnings growth is commensurate.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be adjusted accordingly.

    return value * 1000000

# Example periods with hard-coded values (in months for this example, but could be quarters, etc.)
# Each tuple contains the period length and the average number of diluted shares during that period
# For example, for 2 months there were an average of 5 million diluted shares outstanding
