# Dividends Per Share Calculation
# -------------------------------
# Overview:
# Dividends Per Share (DPS) represents the total dividends paid out over a year 
# per share of outstanding stock. It provides insights into a company's profitability 
# and its policy of returning cash to shareholders.
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher DPS suggests a company's strong profitability and willingness to 
# return cash to shareholders. However, an exceptionally high and unsustainable 
# DPS might indicate a lack of investment in future growth.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be adjusted accordingly.

def convert_to_actual_value(value):
    """Converts the value in the format of 1.00 to actual $1 million."""
    return value * 1000000

# Hard-coded values
total_dividends_paid = convert_to_actual_value(10.00)  # Example: $10 million in total dividends paid
total_shares_outstanding = convert_to_actual_value(1.50) # Example: 1.5 million shares outstanding

# Calculate Dividends Per Share
dps = total_dividends_paid / total_shares_outstanding

print("Factors Influencing Dividends Per Share:")
print("- **Profitability:** A company's ability to generate consistent profits determines its capacity to pay out dividends. Temporary earnings boosts might not always result in higher dividends.")
print("- **Retained Earnings:** The amount of profit retained for reinvestment versus distributed as dividends can influence DPS. Companies with significant growth opportunities might retain more earnings.")
print("- **Debt Levels:** High debt levels might restrict a company's ability to pay dividends. Debt covenants can have restrictions on payouts.")
print("- **Cash Flow Stability:** Even profitable companies can face cash flow issues. Stable cash flows support consistent dividend payments.")
print("- **Industry Norms:** Some industries tend to have higher dividend payouts due to mature operations and limited growth opportunities, while others might prioritize growth investments.")
print("- **Regulatory Environment:** Some jurisdictions or industries have regulations around dividend payments, which can influence DPS.")
print("- **Tax Considerations:** The tax implications for the company and its shareholders can play a role in dividend distribution decisions.")
print("- **Historical Dividend Trends:** Companies might aim to maintain or gradually increase dividends to signal consistent performance to shareholders.")
