# Tax Expense Ratio Calculator
# ----------------------------
# Overview:
# The Tax Expense Ratio indicates the proportion of a company's profits that are paid out as taxes. 
# It provides an insight into the company's tax efficiency and its effective tax rate.
#
# Formula:
# Tax Expense Ratio = Tax Expense / Pre-Tax Income
#
# Desired Value:
# The Tax Expense Ratio provides an understanding of the tax burden on a company's profits. 
# While a low ratio indicates tax efficiency, it could also result from tax incentives, credits, 
# or aggressive tax strategies. A ratio that's too low might signal unsustainably aggressive 
# tax avoidance which can be risky.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Hard-coded values in millions as decimals (e.g., 1.00 is $1 million)

# Pre-Tax Income for the period (in $1M)
pre_tax_income = 10.00  # Example value representing $10 million

# Tax Expense for the period (in $1M)
tax_expense = 2.50  # Example value representing $2.5 million paid as taxes

# Calculate Tax Expense Ratio
tax_expense_ratio = tax_expense / pre_tax_income

# Output the results
print(f"Pre-Tax Income (in $1M): ${pre_tax_income:.2f}M")
print(f"Tax Expense (in $1M): ${tax_expense:.2f}M")
print(f"Tax Expense Ratio: {tax_expense_ratio:.2%}")
print("\nThis ratio gives insight into the effective tax rate the company is experiencing relative to its earnings.\n")

# Provide insights and potential influencing factors
if tax_expense_ratio < 0.20:  # Just an example threshold, adjust as necessary
    print("The company's Tax Expense Ratio is relatively low, suggesting a higher degree of tax efficiency.")
    print("\nPotential factors influencing a lower Tax Expense Ratio include:")
    print("- Benefiting from tax incentives or credits offered by the government.")
    print("- Operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.")
    print("- Effective tax planning strategies.")
    print("- Possibility of using aggressive tax avoidance techniques. If too aggressive, this might pose risks due to regulatory scrutiny.")
    
elif tax_expense_ratio > 0.35:  # Another example threshold, adjust as necessary
    print("The company's Tax Expense Ratio is relatively high, indicating a substantial tax burden on its profits.")
    print("\nPotential factors contributing to a higher Tax Expense Ratio include:")
    print("- Operations in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.")
    print("- Absence of tax incentives or credits.")
    print("- Incurrence of non-deductible expenses which increase the taxable income.")
    print("- Potential areas of inefficiency in tax planning.")
    
else:
    print("The company's Tax Expense Ratio is within a typical range.")
    print("\nIt suggests that the company might be experiencing average tax conditions, aligned with most entities in its jurisdiction or industry.")
