# Return on Sales (ROS) Calculator
# --------------------------------
# Overview:
# Return on Sales (ROS) is a measure of a company's operational profitability. It represents 
# how much profit a company generates for every dollar of sales.
#
# Formula:
# ROS = Net Income / Net Sales
# 
# Desired Value:
# A higher ROS indicates that the company is more efficient in converting sales into profit.
# It means the company has a good grip on its costs relative to its sales.
# A low ROS can suggest inefficiencies or issues in pricing or cost management.
#

# Company's data:
net_income_company = 1177.00  # Net Income in Tikr
net_sales_company = 24442.00  # Revenues in Tikr

# Industry average data:
net_income_industry = 322.00  
net_sales_industry = 4840.00  

# Calculate ROS for the company
ros_company = (net_income_company / net_sales_company) * 100

# Calculate ROS for the industry average
ros_industry = (net_income_industry / net_sales_industry) * 100

# Output the results
print(f"Company's Return on Sales (ROS): {ros_company:.2f}%")
print(f"Industry Average Return on Sales (ROS): {ros_industry:.2f}%")

# Interpretation
if ros_company > ros_industry:
    print("The company's ROS is above the industry average, indicating better operational efficiency.")
    print("\nPotential reasons for superior efficiency include:")
    print("- Effective cost management and cost-cutting strategies.")
    print("- Higher pricing power due to a strong brand or differentiated product offerings.")
    print("- Benefiting from economies of scale, which reduce per-unit costs.")
    print("- Efficient operational processes and resource utilization.")
    print("- Favorable external factors, such as lower input costs or advantageous market conditions.")

elif ros_company < ros_industry:
    print("The company's ROS is below the industry average, suggesting potential operational inefficiencies.")
    print("\nPotential reasons for this disparity might include:")
    print("- Elevated operational or production costs.")
    print("- Reduced pricing power, leading to discounts or lower sale prices.")
    print("- Higher administrative expenses in relation to sales.")
    print("- Challenges such as regulatory issues, stiff competition, or supply chain disruptions.")
    print("- Significant investments in initiatives (e.g., market expansion, R&D) that have yet to yield profitable returns.")

else:
    print("The company's ROS is in line with the industry average.")
    print("\nBeing at par with the industry average suggests that the company faces similar market conditions and challenges as its competitors. While it indicates that the company is on track, it's essential to continually seek improvement to gain a competitive edge.")
