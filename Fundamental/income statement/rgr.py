# Revenue Growth Rate Calculator
# ------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Revenue Growth Rate measures the percentage increase (or decrease) in a company's 
# sales or revenue from one period to the next. It's an essential metric for investors to 
# understand how quickly a company is growing its sales.
#
# Formula:
# Revenue Growth Rate = [(Revenue in Current Period - Revenue in Previous Period) / 
#                        Revenue in Previous Period] x 100%
# 
# Desired Value:
# A higher Revenue Growth Rate indicates that the company is growing its sales at a faster pace.
# However, it's essential to consider industry benchmarks and ensure that growth is sustainable.

# Revenue for the previous period
revenue_previous_period = 50.00  # Revenues in Tikr

# Revenue for the current period
revenue_current_period = 55.00  # Example value representing $55 million

# Calculate Revenue Growth Rate
growth_rate = ((revenue_current_period - revenue_previous_period) / revenue_previous_period) * 100

# Output the result
print(f"Revenue Growth Rate: {growth_rate:.2f}%")
