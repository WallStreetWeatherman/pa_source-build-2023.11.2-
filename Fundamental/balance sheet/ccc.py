# Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) Calculator
# --------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) represents the number of days it takes for a company 
# to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales.
# It's the sum of the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO),
# and the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).
#
# Formula:
# CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO
#
# Desired Value:
# A shorter CCC is generally more favorable as it indicates that a company can more 
# quickly convert its investments into cash. However, it's important to compare CCC 
# across similar companies in the same industry to get a relative perspective.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Hard-coded values

# Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) - Average number of days it takes to collect payment after a sale
DSO = 3.41  # Example value representing 30 days

# Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) - Average number of days to sell inventory
DIO = 107.34  # Example value representing 45 days

# Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) - Average number of days it takes to pay suppliers
DPO = 99.13  # Example value representing 25 days

# Calculate CCC
CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

# Output the results

# Factors and Scenarios Affecting CCC
if CCC < 0:
    print("The company has a negative CCC, which indicates strong working capital management.")
    print("Factors and Scenarios Affecting CCC:")
    print("1. Efficient Collections: Quick receivable turnover and customer payments.")
    print("2. Vendor Terms: Favorable payment terms with suppliers leading to higher DPO.")
    print("3. Just-in-Time Inventory: Efficient inventory management reducing DIO.")
elif CCC > 0 and CCC <= 30:
    print("The company has a short CCC, indicating efficient management of cash flows.")
    print("Factors and Scenarios Affecting CCC:")
    print("1. Quick Sales: Fast-moving inventory contributes to lower DIO.")
    print("2. Strong Customer Credit Policies: Helps in reducing DSO.")
    print("3. Efficient Supplier Negotiation: Managed DPO without straining supplier relationships.")
else:
    print("The company has a longer CCC, which may indicate inefficiencies in cash flow management. This needs to be compared with industry benchmarks for a better perspective.")
    print("Factors and Scenarios Affecting CCC:")
    print("1. Slow-Moving Inventory: Could lead to higher DIO.")
    print("2. Credit Sales: If the firm sells largely on credit, DSO could be higher.")
    print("3. Less Negotiating Power: With suppliers could result in a lower DPO.")
