# Cash to Current Assets Ratio Calculator
# ---------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Cash to Current Assets Ratio reflects the percentage of a company's current assets
# that is comprised of cash or cash equivalents. It provides insights into the liquidity
# position of the company and indicates how much of the company's short-term assets 
# can be easily converted into cash.
#
# Formula:
# Cash to Current Assets Ratio = Cash & Cash Equivalents / Total Current Assets
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher ratio suggests that the company has a higher proportion of its current assets 
# in liquid form, which can be seen as a sign of financial strength, especially in times of 
# uncertainty. However, too high a ratio might also indicate that the company is not 
# reinvesting its cash effectively.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):
    """Convert value where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc."""
    return value_in_millions * 1000000

# Hard-coded values

# Cash & Cash Equivalents (in million dollars format for simplicity)
cash_and_equivalents_in_millions = 438.00  # Cash and equivalants in Tikr
cash_and_equivalents = convert_to_actual_value(cash_and_equivalents_in_millions)

# Total Current Assets (in million dollars format for simplicity)
total_current_assets_in_millions = 16304.00  # Total Current Assests in Tikr
total_current_assets = convert_to_actual_value(total_current_assets_in_millions)

# Industry average for Cash to Current Assets Ratio (for comparison)
industry_average_ratio = 0.25  # Example value; you'd replace this with real data

# Calculate Cash to Current Assets Ratio
cash_to_current_assets_ratio = cash_and_equivalents / total_current_assets

# Output the results
