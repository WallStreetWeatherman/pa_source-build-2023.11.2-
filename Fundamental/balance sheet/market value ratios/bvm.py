# Book Value Margin Analysis
# --------------------------
# Overview:
# Book Value Margin is the ratio of the book value of a company to its revenue.
# It provides insights into how much of the company's revenue is actually attributable to shareholders in terms of book value.
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher Book Value Margin is generally favorable as it indicates a strong balance sheet relative to revenue.
# A lower Book Value Margin may suggest a weaker financial position relative to the company's revenue.

# Function to convert values in $ millions to actual values
def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):
    return value_in_millions * 1000000

# Hardcoded company values (in $ millions, represented as 1.00 for 1 million)
company_revenue_in_millions = 23606.00  
company_book_value_in_millions = 4210.00  

# Convert company values to actual values
company_revenue = convert_to_actual_value(company_revenue_in_millions)
company_book_value = convert_to_actual_value(company_book_value_in_millions)

# Hardcoded industry average values (in $ millions, represented as 1.00 for 1 million)
industry_avg_revenue_in_millions = 32000.00  
industry_avg_book_value_in_millions = 19000.00  

# Convert industry average values to actual values
industry_avg_revenue = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_revenue_in_millions)
industry_avg_book_value = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_book_value_in_millions)

# Calculate Book Value Margin for the company and industry average
company_book_value_margin = company_book_value / company_revenue
industry_avg_book_value_margin = industry_avg_book_value / industry_avg_revenue

# Output the result
print("Book Value Margin Analysis:\n")
print(f"Calculated Book Value Margin for the Company: {company_book_value_margin:.2f}")
print(f"Calculated Book Value Margin for the Industry Average: {industry_avg_book_value_margin:.2f}")

# Interpretation
if company_book_value_margin >= industry_avg_book_value_margin:
    print("\nThe company's Book Value Margin is above the industry average. This could indicate a strong financial position relative to revenue.")
    print("Factors that could be influencing this positive margin include effective cost management, a strong balance sheet, and revenue diversification.")
else:
    print("\nThe company's Book Value Margin is below the industry average. This could suggest areas for improvement in financial management.")
    print("Factors that could be affecting this lower margin include high operational costs, less efficient use of assets, or declining revenues.")

# Additional scenarios to consider:
print("\nAdditional Scenarios to Consider:")
print("1. Market Conditions: Cyclical industries might show fluctuating Book Value Margins.")
print("2. Competitive Landscape: A higher Book Value Margin may not always be favorable if competitors are investing more aggressively for growth.")
print("3. Accounting Practices: Differences in accounting methods can affect the book value and therefore the Book Value Margin.")
