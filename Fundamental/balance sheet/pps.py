# Price Per Share Calculation
# ---------------------------
# Overview:
# Price Per Share is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by its total number of outstanding shares.
# This gives you the price of a single share of the company's stock.
#
# Desired Value:
# Whether a high or low Price Per Share is beneficial depends on various factors, including the investor's strategy and 
# the company's valuation metrics. A high Price Per Share may indicate a more valuable company but may also suggest an 
# overvalued stock. On the other hand, a low Price Per Share might be a bargain but could also indicate a company in distress.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, input data should be sourced from financial
# statements and market data.
