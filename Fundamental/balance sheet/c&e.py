# Cash And Equivalents Analysis
# ------------------------------
# Overview:
# Cash and Equivalents are the company's most liquid assets that can be quickly turned into cash.
# They include assets like physical currency, money market accounts, and short-term government bonds.
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher value of Cash and Equivalents is preferred as it indicates higher liquidity, suggesting 
# that the company can comfortably manage its short-term liabilities.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be adjusted accordingly.

def convert_to_actual_value(value):
    """Converts the value in the format of 1.00 to actual $1 million."""
    return value * 1000000

# Hard-coded values for cash and cash equivalents
cash = convert_to_actual_value(8.00)  # Example: $8 million in physical currency
money_market_accounts = convert_to_actual_value(3.00)  # Example: $3 million in money market accounts
short_term_government_bonds = convert_to_actual_value(4.00)  # Example: $4 million in short-term government bonds

# Calculate Total Cash and Equivalents
total_cash_and_equivalents = cash + money_market_accounts + short_term_government_bonds

# Output the result
desired_cash_and_equivalents_value = convert_to_actual_value(12.00)  # An example desired value for cash and equivalents, say $12 million
