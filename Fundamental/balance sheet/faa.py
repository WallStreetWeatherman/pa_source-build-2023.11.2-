# Financed Assets Approach Calculator
# -----------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Financed Assets Approach provides a measure of the company's assets that are financed either by debt or equity.
# This offers insights into how a company's assets are funded and can suggest the level of financial leverage or risk.
#
# Formula:
# Financed Assets = Total Assets - Non-interest bearing Current Liabilities
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher Financed Assets value indicates that a significant portion of the company's assets are financed by either debt or equity.
# It's crucial to determine the mix of debt and equity financing and compare it with industry standards.
# 
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Convert amounts where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc.
def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):
    return value_in_millions * 1000000

# Hard-coded values for the company

# Total Assets (in million dollars format for simplicity)
total_assets_in_millions = 18000.00
total_assets = convert_to_actual_value(total_assets_in_millions)

# Non-interest bearing Current Liabilities (in million dollars format for simplicity)
non_interest_liabilities_in_millions = 3000.00
non_interest_liabilities = convert_to_actual_value(non_interest_liabilities_in_millions)

# Hard-coded values for industry average

# Industry Average Total Assets (in million dollars format for simplicity)
industry_avg_total_assets_in_millions = 17000.00
industry_avg_total_assets = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_total_assets_in_millions)

# Industry Average Non-interest bearing Current Liabilities (in million dollars format for simplicity)
industry_avg_non_interest_liabilities_in_millions = 2800.00
industry_avg_non_interest_liabilities = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_non_interest_liabilities_in_millions)

# Calculate Financed Assets for the company and industry average
financed_assets = total_assets - non_interest_liabilities
industry_avg_financed_assets = industry_avg_total_assets - industry_avg_non_interest_liabilities

# Convert back to millions for easier readability
financed_assets_in_millions = financed_assets / 1000000
industry_avg_financed_assets_in_millions = industry_avg_financed_assets / 1000000

# Output the results
