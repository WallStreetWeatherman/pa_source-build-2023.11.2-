# Tobin's Q-Ratio Calculation
# ---------------------------
# Overview:
# The Q-Ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, compares the market value of a company's assets to 
# their replacement cost. It can provide insights into whether the market values a 
# company's intangible assets (e.g., brand value, patents, strategic positioning) 
# higher than its tangible assets.
#
# Desired Value:
# A Q-ratio above 1 indicates that the market values the company higher than the 
# replacement cost of its tangible assets. This could be due to the company's intangible 
# assets or expectations of future growth. A Q-ratio below 1 might suggest potential 
# undervaluation, but a holistic analysis is crucial.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, input data 
# should be sourced from financial statements and market data.
